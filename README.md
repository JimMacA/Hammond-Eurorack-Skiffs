# Hammond-Eurorack-Skiffs
Inexpensive powered Eurorack skiffs made from PCBs and Hammond enclosures

ER1550K uses a Hammond 1550K. It provides a depth of 2.8" and a width of 12HP.
ER1550F uses a Hammond 1550F. It provides a depth of 3.9" and a width of 22HP.
Both create regulated +/-12V and +5V from a +15V input, 
with the option of disabling the +5V switcher to reduce noise.
Warning: the voltage regulators used in this design are not maker-friendly --
you may want to replace them with off-the-shelf regulators.

Eurorack modules may be bolted directly to the PCBs, which requires removing the PCBs from the enclosures
(a simple matter of removing 4 screws).
Alternatively, you can use Schroff threaded strip 34561384 (DigiKey 1439-1327-ND)
mounted behind the PCBs and held in place by already-installed modules.

I've included pdfs of schematics, Gerber files, and Altium source files.
